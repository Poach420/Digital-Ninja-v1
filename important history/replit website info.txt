Autonomy & validation
Fast Mode

Copy page

Make targeted changes in seconds with Agent’s Fast mode. Up to 5x faster and typically cheaper per prompt than autonomous mode.

Fast mode is a lightning-quick version of Replit Agent optimized for targeted changes. Get visual tweaks, bug fixes, and reasonable-sized features in 10-60 seconds instead of waiting minutes. Perfect for rapid iteration and pair programming.
​
What is Fast Mode?
Fast mode is a specialized Agent experience designed for speed and precision. While the full Agent excels at creating comprehensive applications and implementing complex features, Fast mode focuses on quick, scoped changes that don’t require extensive planning or testing.
Fast mode requires an existing app or project. Use Fast mode to make changes within apps you’ve already created. To build a new app from scratch, use the full Agent experience.
Think of Fast mode as your pair programming partner for those moments when you need focused changes within your existing app. It’s built to keep you in flow without having to step away from your computer while waiting for longer builds to complete.
Fast mode is primarily accessed via the lightning bolt (⚡) icon in the Agent prompt box, and can also be toggled through the Autonomy level control in Agent Tools.

​
When to Use Fast Mode
Fast mode is ideal for:
Visual tweaks: Adjusting colors, spacing, fonts, or layout elements
Reasonable-sized features: Adding search bars, creating loading states, building form validation, or adding sorting functionality
Quick fixes: Correcting typos, fixing broken links, or addressing minor bugs
Rapid iteration: Making a series of focused changes while actively developing
Scoped updates: When you know exactly what you want changed and don’t need extensive planning
Fast mode may not be suitable for:
Creating new apps: Fast mode only works within existing apps—use full Agent to start from scratch
Complex features: Multi-file changes that require architectural decisions
Large-scale refactoring: Restructuring code across multiple components
New integrations: Adding third-party APIs or services
Database schema changes: Modifying data structures or relationships
For these larger tasks, use the full Agent experience which includes comprehensive planning, testing, and validation.
​
Features
Fast mode delivers a streamlined development experience with the following capabilities:
Lightning-fast execution: Complete most changes in 10-60 seconds
Targeted modifications: Makes only the changes you request without expanding scope
Cost-effective development: Typically cheaper per prompt than autonomous mode
Real-time pair programming: Stay at your computer and keep building without long waits
Predictable results: Focused changes mean fewer surprises and more control
​
How to Use Fast Mode
​
Primary Access: Lightning Bolt Button
The quickest way to toggle Fast mode is using the lightning bolt (⚡) icon in the Agent prompt box:
Agent input box with Fast mode enabled, showing 'Quick, lightweight changes' text and highlighted lightning bolt icon
Open Agent in your Replit App
Click the ⚡ icon in the prompt box to enable Fast mode
Make your request—keep it focused and specific
Toggle off when you need full Agent for complex tasks
​
Alternative Access: Agent Tools
You can also access Fast mode from Agent Tools:
Agent Tools panel showing Fast mode option with 'Make lightweight changes, quickly' description and Autonomous option below with autonomy level controls
Open the Agent Tools panel and select Fast from the options. Fast mode and Autonomous mode are two distinct approaches: choose Fast when you want quick results while staying at your computer, or Autonomous when you prefer more reliable, longer builds and can step away for a few minutes or more.
​
Example Prompts
Good for Fast mode:
“Change the submit button text from ‘Send’ to ‘Submit Application’”
“Increase the padding in the card component to 24px”
“Add email validation to the signup form”
“Make the sidebar background color darker”
“Add a search bar to filter the product list”
“Create a loading spinner when data is fetching”
Use full Agent for:
“Build a new todo app from scratch”
“Redesign the entire user dashboard”
“Add user authentication with Replit Auth”
“Integrate Stripe payment processing”
“Add a Linear connector”
​
How Fast Mode Works
Fast mode uses a streamlined version of Agent’s AI technology that’s optimized for speed and scoped changes:
Focused analysis: Fast mode analyzes only the relevant files for your specific request
Direct implementation: Makes changes immediately without extensive planning phases
Streamlined execution: Skips comprehensive testing and architecture review for faster results
Quick validation: Performs basic checks to ensure changes don’t break existing functionality
This approach allows Fast mode to deliver results up to 5x faster for scoped requests while maintaining quality for the types of focused, well-defined changes it’s designed to handle.
​
What’s Different in Fast Mode
To achieve faster speeds, Fast mode disables certain features:
Disabled in Fast mode:
Autonomy levels: Fast mode and Autonomous mode are mutually exclusive—choose Fast for speed or Autonomous for reliability
App Testing: No automated browser testing
Architect: No architectural analysis
Still available:
Web search: Access real-time information
Other Agent tools: File operations, code editing, image generation, and more
Starter plan users can only use Fast Mode: To try the full Autonomous mode, you will need to be on a paid plan.
​
Pricing
Fast mode offers cost-effective pricing that’s typically cheaper per prompt than using autonomous mode. The exact cost depends on the complexity and scope of your request, but Fast mode’s streamlined approach means you’ll generally pay less for focused, scoped changes.
Effort-based pricing: Fast mode uses the same effort-based pricing model as full Agent. Because Fast mode completes tasks more quickly and with a more focused scope, the total cost per request is typically lower than using autonomous mode for the same change.
For detailed information about AI pricing and how effort is calculated, see AI billing.
​
Use Cases
Visual iteration: Quickly try different colors, spacing, and layouts while actively designing
Reasonable-sized features: Add scoped functionality like search filters, form validation, or loading states
Bug fixes: Polish details rapidly before launch
​
Comparison: Fast Mode vs. Full Agent
Feature	Fast Mode	Full Agent
Speed	10-60 seconds	3-10+ minutes
Best for	Targeted, scoped changes	Complex features and full apps
Scope	Focused, well-defined requests	Multi-file, architectural changes
Testing	Basic validation	Comprehensive App Testing
Code Review	None	Available with autonomy levels
Planning	Minimal	Detailed task lists and proposals
Cost	Typically cheaper per prompt	Higher but more capable
​
Tips for Success
Use Fast mode for iteration and full Agent for new features
Keep requests specific for the fastest results
Switch modes when needed: If your change requires multiple files or complex logic, toggle off Fast mode
Review changes immediately while context is fresh

Autonomy & validation
App Testing

Copy page

Agent’s self-testing feature that validates your app’s functionality using an actual browser, with visual feedback and automatic issue resolution.

App Testing is a powerful new feature in Agent 3 that allows Agent to test itself using an actual browser. Agent tests the apps it builds by navigating through your application like a real user would, clicking around and validating functionality. This self-testing capability helps ensure your app works correctly and allows Agent to catch and fix issues automatically.
New in Agent 3: App Testing represents a major advancement in Agent’s autonomous capabilities, enabling more reliable and higher-quality app development.
​
How App Testing works
Watch App Testing in action as Agent navigates through your app:
When App Testing is enabled, Agent will periodically decide to test itself when it thinks enough has changed to deem it necessary. Agent doesn’t test after 100% of user messages, but intelligently determines when testing would be most valuable.
At this time, App Testing is available for Full Stack JavaScript and Streamlit Python web applications.
​
Key Benefits
Extended Autonomy: Enables Agent to work for longer periods without requiring human intervention
Higher Quality: Produces apps with fewer mistakes by identifying and addressing issues early
Cost Efficiency: Prevents the need for additional debugging sessions by catching problems during development
Interactive Review: Provides video replays and section-by-section navigation for thorough result analysis
​
The Testing Process
When Agent decides to test itself, here’s what happens:
Browser Preview: You’ll see a browser preview within the Agent pane
Visual Testing: Watch Agent’s cursor as it clicks around your app, testing functionality
Real User Simulation: Agent navigates through your application just like a real user would, entering mock data when necessary
Automatic Analysis: Agent analyzes the test results and identifies any issues
Self-Correction: Agent reports back with a summary of its tests and automatically fixes any issues that crop up
​
Key capabilities
Agent intelligently tests your application by navigating through it like a real user would, covering:
User interface validation: Buttons, forms, navigation, and visual elements
Functionality verification: Core features and user workflows
Integration testing: API calls, database interactions, and third-party services
Performance and accessibility: Load times, responsiveness, and accessibility standards
​
Usage
App Testing can be toggled on/off within the “Agent Tools” section of the input box within your Repl. When enabled, Agent intelligently decides when to test based on the changes made to your app.
App Testing is part of Agent 3’s autonomous capabilities. Learn more about Autonomy Level settings and other Agent features.
​
Take over
Sometimes the Agent will encounter a roadblock during testing that it needs your help with to continue. Most commonly this involves logging in to a user account (e.g. Gmail). In these cases, the Agent will pop up with a button to “Begin take over.”
App Testing take over interface showing Skip and Begin take over buttons with instructions for handling errors and CAPTCHAs
Pressing “Begin take over” enables you to click into the testing preview, complete the requisite steps, then allow the Agent to continue. You can also press “Skip” to skip take over, ending the App Testing if the Agent cannot proceed without your help. If you do not respond within 10 minutes, the Agent will continue as if you pressed “Skip.”
​
What to expect
Skip option: Use the skip button to bypass testing if needed and continue with development
Interactive video replay: After testing, click the video to replay the entire testing session
Section navigation: Use the sliders at the bottom to jump to specific sections of the test
The interactive replay interface allows you to review the complete testing session:
Interactive video replay interface showing the testing session with navigation controls
​
Troubleshooting
Tests failing unexpectedly
Try skipping then prompting again to test
Check for dynamic content that might affect test timing
Review test scenarios for accuracy
Missing test coverage
Provide more detailed descriptions of your app’s functionality
Explicitly mention critical user flows that should be tested
App Testing not working at all?
App Testing only works with web applications* at this time
​
Pricing and usage
App Testing is included as part of Agent’s effort-based pricing model with important cost considerations:
Usage-based: Testing is charged based on the effort spent (simpler tests are less expensive)
Cost vs. Benefit: While testing costs money, it can save costs by avoiding additional prompts and extra work from Agent by catching mistakes earlier
Efficient Development: Automated approach reduces the need for manual debugging and rework
Cost-Effective Testing: Although App Testing adds to your usage costs, it often saves money overall by preventing the need for additional Agent sessions to fix issues that could have been caught during testing.
​

## Key Features

### Task Planning

Plan mode excels at breaking down complex projects into manageable tasks. Provide the Agent some requirements and it will generate an ordered task list of the development tasks necessary to complete your request.

### Collaborative Brainstorming

Work together with AI to explore different approaches:

* *Multiple solution paths* for complex problems
* *Pros and cons analysis* of different approaches
* *Risk assessment* and mitigation strategies

## Workflow: From Planning to Building

### 1. Planning Phase (Plan Mode)

Start your development process in Plan mode:

* *Define your project scope* and objectives
* *Break down requirements* into specific features
* *Plan your architecture* and technology stack
* *Create a development roadmap* with milestones

### 2. Task Approval

When Agent generates a task list:

* *Review* the proposed tasks
* Select *Start building* to approve the plan

or, keep chatting to refine the plan.

### 3. Transition to Build Mode

When you're ready to start implementing:

* *Click "Start building"* to approve the plan
* *Agent automatically switches* to Build mode
* *Agent begins implementation* of approved tasks
* *Track progress* through the development phase

Plan Mode usage follows the same effort-based pricing as other Agent interactions. You are charged for all Agent work in Plan Mode, including answering questions, providing guidance, and generating task lists. Charges scale up for more complex requests, or requests in longer context conversations.

*All Agent interactions are billable* - whether Agent responds with text guidance or makes code changes, there is always a charge, though smaller requests cost less.

## Use Cases

### Feature Planning

Ideal for adding new functionality:

* *Break down complex features* into implementable tasks
* *Plan database changes* and API modifications
* *Design user interface* and user experience flows
* *Consider edge cases* and error handling

Agent supports three types of integrations so you can go from idea to app, fast:

* *Replit managed*: Built-in integrations that work automatically. Create an app and your Agent can start using these right away.
* *Connectors*: First-party integrations Replit supports. Sign in once, then build with them across your apps.
* *External integrations*: Trusted third-party services you can build with. Ask Agent to set them up; you'll provide API keys.

<Note>
  *Core and Teams only*: Third-party connectors require a Core or Teams subscription. Starter plan users can use Replit-managed integrations like databases, authentication, etc.
</Note>

## Getting started

To use an integration, mention the service or functionality you need. For example:

<AiPrompt>
  Create a web app that uses Stripe to accept payments and SendGrid to send confirmation emails
</AiPrompt>

Agent automatically detects these keywords and implements the necessary code and configuration.

## Replit managed integrations

These built-ins require no setup. Just ask Agent to use them.

    <AiPrompt>Set up a custom domain for my app</AiPrompt>
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Connectors

Connectors let Agent build with your real data. They are first-party integrations supported by Replit. Sign in once on the Connectors page in your Workspace, then reuse those connections across apps.

<Note>
  Connections are tied to your Replit account and persist across all your apps. Connect a service once and use it in any app you create.

## External integrations

Trusted third-party services. Ask Agent to set them up; you'll provide API keys.

<Note>
  API keys are stored securely in your app's [Secrets](/replit-workspace/workspace-features/secrets). Agent will prompt you to add the key when needed.
