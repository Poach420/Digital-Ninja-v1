COPILOT CONTINUATION SUMMARY
Project Context:

This project was migrated from OneDrive to a local folder due to sync/corruption issues.
All critical rules, onboarding files, and documentation (PROJECT_SUMMARY.md, UNIVERSAL_COPILOT_RULES.md, README.md) are preserved and must be present in the new workspace.
The current working folder is:
C:\Users\User 1\dyad-apps\DIGITAL-NINJA RET
Automation Rules:

Copilot must act as a fully automated agent, executing tasks directly and continuing until the problem is solved.
All generated code must follow CRITICAL RULES:
NO placeholder functions or TODO comments
NO "implement this" messages
COMPLETE working application only
Professional styling included
Return ONLY valid code and config, no markdown/code blocks unless required for documentation
Workflow:

On startup, scan the project folder for structure and dependencies.
Automate setup, build, and verification for both frontend and backend.
Ensure all onboarding context and rules are preserved and referenced.
Minimize user burden: do not require repeated instructions or manual intervention unless absolutely necessary.
Next Steps for Copilot:

Scan the new Dyad folder for all files and dependencies.
Automate setup and build for frontend (npm install/start) and backend (pip install/start).
Verify the app runs locally and matches requirements.
If anything is missing, prompt for the exact file or info needed and continue.
User Intent:

The user expects Copilot to continue seamlessly, using this summary and the onboarding files as context, without requiring repeated instructions.
