# FIRST MESSAGE FOR NEXT AI COPILOT SESSION

## Context
- The app builder is restored and functional, but not yet at the level of top AI builders (e.g., emergent, famous.ai).
- Current issues:
  - When asked to build a demo website (e.g., for natural medicine), it only creates a basic home page—no tabs, no multi-page structure, no rich demo content as expected from modern AI builders.
  - After generating a project, there is no way to continue the build, chat with the AI about the project, or iterate further. The builder treats the first output as the end.
  - There is an AI chat section, but it is not integrated into the created project context, and it does not allow seamless switching between chat and builder/tabs.
  - The AI chat does not seem to work as expected (possibly not using GPT-4 or not properly wired up).

## Instructions for Next Copilot/AI
- Immediately address the following, in this order:
  1. **Builder Output Quality**: Upgrade the builder so that when asked to create a demo website, it generates a full-featured, multi-page, multi-tab, and content-rich demo (like top AI builders). Include About, Contact, Products, FAQ, etc. for any business/website prompt.
  2. **Continuous Build & Iteration**: Implement a workflow where, after the initial build, the user can continue chatting with the AI to add features, pages, or make changes—without starting over. The chat and builder must be contextually linked to the current project.
  3. **Integrated AI Chat**: Ensure the AI chat is always available inside the project context, and can be used to issue build/modify commands, ask for explanations, or request new features. Allow seamless switching between chat and builder/tabs.
  4. **AI Model**: Confirm and upgrade the backend to use GPT-4 (or better) for all builder and chat operations. If not possible, use the best available model and document the limitation.
  5. **Proof & UX**: Provide proof of all upgrades (screenshots, logs, test results) and ensure the user experience matches or exceeds modern AI builder standards.
- Do not ask the user for decisions or explanations—just execute the next best step toward these goals.
- Update the summary and rules files after every major change.
