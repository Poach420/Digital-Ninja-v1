Command: .venv/Scripts/python.exe -m pytest
Result: Interrupted after hanging during collection.
Reason: test_services.py establishes a MongoClient at import time and waits for a reachable DATABASE_URL. Environment variables (DATABASE_URL, OPENAI_API_KEY, etc.) are not provisioned in the current workspace, causing external service calls to stall. Manual termination issued after no progress.
Action: Provide test doubles or inject env configuration/mocks before re-running full suite.
