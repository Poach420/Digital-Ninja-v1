# DIGITAL NINJA: Working State Proof (2026-01-06)

## Current Status
- Backend server: Running, connected to MongoDB Atlas
- Frontend server: Running, React app loads at http://localhost:3000
- All dependencies installed and up to date
- .env/config files present
- Registration, login, builder, and chat flows tested and working

## Next Steps
- Integrate AI chat directly into the builder UI for continuous build/iteration
- Enable multi-turn chat for reasoning and next-step planning
- Begin upgrades after confirming stable working state

## Preservation
- This state is now the baseline for recovery and future upgrades
- Use `startup.ps1` before every session to restore this state
